<p>I am starting today with Ulysses and this page is a journal I hope to keep track of my thoughts on
that much analyzed&nbsp;book. </p>
<p>James Joyce is an acquired taste. Reviews of his works are never balanced. They sway from
disgruntled dismissals of impatient deserters to gushing praises of literature geeks who have
invested so much time with the book that they can&#8217;t possibly admit that it&#8217;s not the best thing
since Shakespeare. The truth about the quality of his works, I believe, lies somewhere in the
middle. The complexity of his language, praised and despised in equal measure is both essential and
artificial. Essential because his subject matter is not trivial and artificial because he takes
things a bit too seriously. At least, so it was in the Portrait. There are places where you cannot
take a single word out without diminishing the text and there are places where you feel things are
complex for the sake of being complex. Or so the deserters will tell&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>As for me, I really liked the Portrait. It is very familiar for reasons I do not know. If I count
what I have common with Stephen, I can list a few things: a similar (though significantly lower
quality) catholic education, similar family economics, similar confusions about religion and a
similar ever-present suspicion that I&#8217;m where I shouldn&#8217;t be. There are similarities, yet, Stephen&#8217;s
world is different, his particulars aren&#8217;t mine, and yet they&#8217;re familiar, just as Joyce said they
would be: <em>In the particular is contained the&nbsp;universal.</em></p>
<p>I cannot claim I get all of the Portrait, there are bits I do not understand, but still I get enough
of it to like it. And, that I think is the trouble with Joyce, the depth of reference in his works
is so deep that you&#8217;re always left wondering if you really understand what he&#8217;s trying to do with
you. To some this constant dilemma is disheartening, tiring and repelling and to others, myself
included, it&#8217;s magnetic. That explains why I&#8217;m starting&nbsp;Ulysses. </p>
<p>So then, <em>old artificer, stand me now and in ever good&nbsp;stead.</em> </p>
<p>The day is June 16, 1904, its morning, and&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<h5><i class="icon-time"></i> 19 May&nbsp;2013</h5>
<p><strong>Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead</strong>. So it begins, and I like of the sound of it
when I read it aloud. Buck Mulligan is the first character we encounter and the most striking thing
about him so far is the sound of his name. Buck Mulligan, say it out loud, it has a nice ring to
it. His full name however, is Malachi Mulligan, and the <strong>two repeated dactyls</strong> is Joyce&#8217;s way of
reminding us that he&#8217;s basing this character on a certain Oliver Gogarty, with whom he spent his
Dublin days. There&#8217;s also the obvious reference to St. Malachi of Ireland, but that reference is
ironical because Mulligan is anything but a saint as far as the catholic church goes. He&#8217;s actually
quite a disrespectful and blasphemous young man who starts his day mocking the daily mass and the
transfiguration. <strong>A little trouble about the white corpuscles</strong>. The detail of the white blood cells
alludes to the fact that he&#8217;s a medical&nbsp;student.</p>
<p><strong>Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!</strong>. Up comes our very own Stephen Dedalus. Complaining
about the third resident of the seaside tower, where they&#8217;re presently lodged. This third resident
is an English man learning the Irish ways. He&#8217;s invented, it seems, for the same reasons that the
dean of studies was invented in the Portrait: to express Stephen&#8217;s ambivalence towards the
English. He doesn&#8217;t like the people, but he&#8217;s speaking their language. Mr. Haines however is almost
delusional and the night before broke up imagining himself with a black&nbsp;panther.</p>
<p>Stephen, as we know, abandoned his faith at the end of the Portrait much to her mother&#8217;s
dismay. Here we learn that the poor woman actually died a little while later. On her deathbed she
asked Stephen to pray for her soul, but Stephen, being Joyce, having no faith left to pray, did not
kneel down at her side and that, everyone believed, was very cruel. Mulligan calls it
<strong>sinister</strong>. Stephen, guilty, sad, remembers his mother. <strong>Pain, that was not yet the pain of love,
fretted his heart</strong> He&#8217;s haunted by her mother&#8217;s memories, and there are allusions to Hamlet and
Telemachus. Two literary heroes, one mourning a dead parent the other seeking his who is assumed&nbsp;dead.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s a sequence of dialogs between Stephen and Mulligan, that establish that neither of them
like each other. Mulligan is constantly mocking Stephen and Stephen for some reason, that&#8217;s not very
clear, taking it all very quietly. In between there&#8217;s the <strong>cracked looking-glass of a servant</strong>
analogy for Irish art. Mulligan, having shaved, turns the mirror onto Stephen, to remind him of his
scruffy appearance. Stephen looks and sees himself, <strong>As he and others see me</strong> and isn&#8217;t happy with
what he sees inside. His reaction at looking his own face triggers Mulligan to quote&nbsp;Wilde:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The nineteenth century dislike of Realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.<br />
The nineteenth century dislike of Romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.
<small>Oscar Wilde, The Preface of &#8216;The Picture of Dorian Gray&#8217;</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stephen, <strong>drawing back</strong> dismisses it (the mirror) as a symbol of Irish art. Calling a mirror a
symbol of art is mostly obvious by Joycean standards. But, why cracked? And why of a servant?  Of a
servant, because it literally was picked up by Mulligan from the servant&#8217;s room, but in the analogy,
it represents the servile nature of Irish art, mostly due to English colonial rule of over
Ireland. Apparently, there were restrictions on what&#8217;s acceptable in works of art and what&#8217;s not by
the English authorities, much like how it was in India before independence. Looked in that way, the
<strong>cracked looking-glass of a servant</strong> is apt for Indian art too, most of the popular literature has
been in English, the language of our erstwhile conquerors. I am, after all, writing this in English,
with feelings of ambivalence not very different from what Joyce had himself about the&nbsp;language.</p>
<p>Then comes vintage Joyce. Of Stephen remembering his mother, her possesions and the prayer he wish
he would have said at her death bed. Read it in the book. I can&#8217;t add anything more to it. They go
down from the roof of the tower and eat breakfast. In between there&#8217;s a very nice bit about Mulligan
shaving bowl forgotten on the parapet. Stephen wonders if he should leave it there all day, as his
forgotten friendship, or bring it down. He brings it down and rues the fact that he&#8217;s still an alter
servant. <strong>I am another now and yet the same</strong>. </p>
<p>Mulligan makes breakfast, the milk woman comes and Stephen compares her to old Mother Ireland
<strong>serving her conquerer and her gay betrayer</strong>.</p>
