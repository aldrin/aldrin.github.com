title: enable_shared_from_this

When I first [ran][ex] into `enable_shared_from_this` it looked like something out of the bag of
incomprehensible Boost tricks. However, if you consider the problem it solves and try solving it *ab
initio*, it is, [curiously][crtp], not *very* complicated. Here's the problem: write a class
instance method that returns a reference-counted pointer to the instance itself. In other words,
write a method that can wrap `this` inside a `shared_ptr` and return it. Here's a simplified
use-case for such a thing.

Consider the task of writing an two classes: `student` and `course`, as shown below:

```cpp
// forward declaration
struct student;

// models a course being offered
struct course
{
  // enroll a student for this course
  void enroll(const shared_ptr<student>& s){ enrolled_.push_back(s); }
private:
  // the list of enrolled students.
  vector<shared_ptr<student >> enrolled_;
};

// models a student
struct student
{
  // offer a course and the student enrolls if interested
  void offer(course& c) { if(interested_in(c)) { c.enroll(shared_from_this()); } }
  // how do we implement this?
  virtual shared_ptr<student> shared_from_this() = 0;
private:
  // internal implementation of what interests a student
  bool interested_in(course& c) { return true; }
};
```

So how does one implement the `student::shared_from_this`? We can't just wrap and return `this`, can we?

```c++
struct obviously_bad_student: public student
{
  shared_ptr<student> shared_from_this(){ return shared_ptr<student>(this); }
};

int main()
{
  course math;
  shared_ptr<student> s = make_shared<obviously_bad_student>();
  s->offer(math); // invalid delete
} 
```

Of course not, this will eventually end up with an invalid delete. Conceptually, it isn't different
from the following:

```c++
void test_sp_bad_usage()
{
  int *i = new int; // the raw pointer
  shared_ptr<int> p(i); // wrap it up
  shared_ptr<int> q(i); // wrap it again (bad)
} // <- invalid delete (double delete)
```

How about storing the `shared_ptr` instance inside the `student` object itself and returning it
back. It messes up the `student` abstraction, but, how about the following?

```c++
struct self_aware_leaky_student: public student
{
  // let an instance know its wrapped in a shared pointer
  void know_thyself(shared_ptr<student> s) { self_ = s; }
  // return the stored pointer
  shared_ptr<student> shared_from_this() { return self_; }
private:
  shared_ptr<student> self_;
};

int main()
{
  course math;
  shared_ptr<self_aware_leaky_student> s = make_shared<self_aware_leaky_student>();
  s->know_thyself(s);
  s->offer(math);
  assert(s.use_count()==3); // enrolled_, s, s->self_ (should be 2)
}
```

As the final `assert` confirms, this creates a cyclic reference and the instance will never be freed
up. What we need to get this to work is a `weak_ptr`. Here's a simple test that illustrates its
usage:

```c++
void test_wp_expected_usage()
{
  shared_ptr<int> p(new int); // a shared pointer
  weak_ptr<int> w(p); // make a weak reference
  {
    assert(1 == p.use_count()); // only 1 owner: p
    shared_ptr<int> q = w.lock(); // encash the weak ref
    assert(2 == q.use_count()); // 2 owners now: p, q
  } // q goes out of scope
  assert(1 == w.use_count()); // we're back to one owner
  p.reset(); // explicitly reset p.
  assert(w.expired()); // w knows it is dangling now.
}
```

A `weak_ptr` does not claim ownership to the underlying object, it is just a rain-check we keep to
claim ownership in the future, if we need to. We can't access the underlying pointer directly from a
`weak_ptr`, we need to `lock` it first, and in doing so create a `shared_ptr` that shares ownership
with the original `share_ptr`.

With this new tool in hand, here's another attempt:

```c++
struct almost_right_student: public student
{
  // let an instance know its wrapped in a shared pointer
  void know_thyself(shared_ptr<student> s) { self_ = s; }
  shared_ptr<student> shared_from_this() { return self_.lock(); }
private:
  weak_ptr<student> self_;
};

int main()
{
  course math;
  shared_ptr<almost_right_student> s = make_shared<almost_right_student>();
  s->know_thyself(s);
  s->offer(math);
  assert(s.use_count()==2); // enrolled_, s
}
```

This works, there are no leaks and no double deletes. The only problem is that we've polluted the
student interface with implementation details. Users of the `student` class must ensure that
`know_thyself` was invoked before using the instance. That's not nice, but is there an alternative?
Yes, and it's called (surprise!) `enable_shared_from_this`.

> A class `T` can inherit from `enable_shared_from_this<T>` to inherit the
> `shared_from_this` member functions that obtain a `shared_ptr` instance pointing to `*this`.
> <small>20.7.2.4.1 in <cite>C++ Standard</cite></small>

The standard then goes on to suggest a possible implementation which is quite like the one we just
wrote (but a lot better).

```c++
// 20.7.2.4.10
template<class T> class enable_shared_from_this {
private:
  weak_ptr<T> __weak_this;
protected:
  constexpr enable_shared_from_this(): __weak_this() {}
  enable_shared_from_this(enable_shared_from_this const &) {}
  enable_shared_from_this& operator=(enable_shared_from_this const &) { return *this; }
  ~enable_shared_from_this() {}
public:
  shared_ptr<T> shared_from_this() { return shared_ptr<T>(__weak_this); }
  shared_ptr<T const> shared_from_this() const { return shared_ptr<T const>(__weak_this); }
};
```

Finally, it puts the last bit that was missing from our solution.

In other words, if the class extends `enable_shared_from_this` the standard implementation of
`shared_ptr` will invoke the equivalent of `know_thyself` to populate the weak reference without the
end users having to do it explicitly. So, in conclusion, the best implementation of the `student`
class, as we require it, is quite simply:

```c++
struct student : public enable_shared_from_this<student>
{
  // offer a course and the student enrolls if interested
  void offer(course& c) { if(interested_in(c)) { c.enroll(shared_from_this()); } }
private:
  // internal implementation of what interests a student
  bool interested_in(course& c) { return true; }
}
```

That's about it. The code in this post, should you have a use for it is [here][gist].
